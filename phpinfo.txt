PHP includes a complete object model.
Some of its features are:(visibility, abstract and final classes and methods),
additional magic methods, interfaces, and cloning.

PHP treats objects in the same way as references or handles,
meaning that each variable contains an object reference rather than a copy of the entire object.
See Objects and References.
/***********Visibility ***********/
The visibility of a property, a method or (as of PHP 7.1.0) a constant can be defined 
by prefixing the declaration with the keywords (public, protected or private).
Class members declared (public) can be accessed everywhere.
Members declared (protected) can be accessed only within the class itself and by inheriting and parent classes.
Members declared as (private) may only be accessed by the class that defines the member.

/******************Property Visibility? ****/
Class properties may be defined as public, private, or protected. Properties declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as (public).
/**************Method Visibility *****************/
Class methods may be defined as public, private, or protected. Methods declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as (public).
/*********************Constant Visibility ************/
As of PHP 7.1.0, class (constants) may be defined as (public, private, or protected).
(Constants) declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as (public).

/**********/
Just a quick note that it's possible to declare visibility for multiple properties at the same time, by separating them by commas.
/*****************************/
Beware: Visibility works on a per-class-base and does not prevent instances of the same class accessing each others properties!
/*****************************/
Members declared protected can be accessed only within 
> the class itself and by inherited classes. Members declared 
> as private may only be accessed by the class that defines 
> the member.

This is not strictly true. Code outside the object can get and set private and protected members:
